### **<p align="center">A Python-based analytics report designed to display the correlation between city types and Pyber Ride-Share fares.</p>**

## Overview
This report will enumerate the differences in ride share data among the Urban, Suburban and Rural city types. The identified correlations between City Type and Fare Revenue will be used at the end of this report to provide business recommendations for future Pyber ride sharing ventures.

1. **Volume of Rides:** The amount of rides by city type increases as you approach more populated areas.
2. **Number of Drivers:** The number of available drivers also increases as the city type approaches Urban.
   >As a result of an increased availability of drivers and greater volume of rides, Urban cities total more than 200% of the Total Suburban city Fare Revenue and 900% of the Total Rural city Fare Revenue.
3. **Average Fare Costs:** Rural and Suburban cities garner significantly more Fare Revenue per ride and per driver than Urban Cities.

## Summary
---

The total Fare Revenue is greatest from Urban cities, however, Suburban and Rural cities garner a greater per-ride and per-driver fare. In order to increase overall Fare Revnue, i would suggest the following:

1. Hire additonal drivers for Rural and Suburban cities.
2. Increase the Fare cost in Urban and Suburban cities to reflect the respective demand based on total rides.
3. Reduce the number of drivers for Urban cities, as there is a surplus of drivers-to-rides.
